## Welcome to Yifan Guo's Pages

Welcome to my homepage! My name is Yifan Guo(郭一凡). Now I’m a junior undergraduate from the School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China. I’m pursuing a B.S. degree in math.

The page is still under construction. Feel free to look around.
